## List of projects that have considered implementing one or more of the fediverse standards (OStatus, ActivityPub, Diaspora, Zot)

*Note*: once the developers of an app firmly commit to an implementation, it will be moved from this list to the watchlist for the relevant protocol. Most of these projects include both a back-end and a web client, but this list also includes projects that are only a back-end. Projects that are only a web app, for use with an existing back-end, will go on the [client watchlist](https://gitlab.com/fediverse/fediverse.gitlab.io/wikis/watchlist-for-client-apps).

* [Communecter](https://github.com/pixelhumain/) - already supports ActivityStreams, [plans to implement the rest of AP](https://www.loomio.org/d/Y8kHSzPE/activitypub-as-a-decentralized-oae-infrastructure-/3). Codebase is currently being [refactored into a set of smaller components](https://www.loomio.org/d/Y8kHSzPE/activitypub-as-a-decentralized-oae-infrastructure-/19).
