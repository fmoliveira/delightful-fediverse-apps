## List of projects that have considered implementing one or more of the fediverse standards (OStatus, ActivityPub, Diaspora, Zot)

*Note*: once the developers of an app firmly commit to an implementation, please move it from this list to the watchlist for the relevant protocol. Most of these projects include both a back-end and a web client, but this list also includes projects that are only a back-end. Projects that are only a web app, for use with an existing back-end, will go on the [client watchlist](https://git.feneas.org/feneas/fediverse/wikis/watchlist-for-client-apps).

* :black_nib: [Communecter](https://github.com/pixelhumain/) - already supports ActivityStreams, [plans to implement the rest of ActivityPub](https://www.loomio.org/d/Y8kHSzPE/activitypub-as-a-decentralized-oae-infrastructure-/3). Codebase is currently being [refactored into a set of smaller components](https://www.loomio.org/d/Y8kHSzPE/activitypub-as-a-decentralized-oae-infrastructure-/19).

* :black_nib: [Dreamwidth](https://github.com/dreamwidth/dw-free/issues/2337) - a blogging engine forked from LiveJournal. Some discussion of the possibilities of supporting ActivityPub.

* :black_nib: [Ghost](https://forum.ghost.org/t/federate-over-activitypub/1989/15) - some discussion of the possibilities of supporting ActivityPub.

* :black_nib: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/4013) - some discussion of the possibilities of supporting ActivityPub. See also: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/30991 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/44486. Most likely to happen if and when ForgeFed is completed.

* :black_nib: [Human Connection](https://github.com/Human-Connection/Human-Connection/issues/114) - some discussion of the possibilities of supporting ActivityPub.

* :black_nib: [Kitsune](https://github.com/valerauko/kitsune/issues/14) - considering supporting the Diaspora standard.

* :black_nib: [MediaGoblin](https://issues.mediagoblin.org/ticket/5503) - streaming of any and all media files. Has been in "[unofficial retirement](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19779594)", but an [early 2020 dev meeting](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/mediagoblin-2020-02-15) mentions federation (presumably using AP).

* :black_nib: :tada: [Minds](https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/issues/183) - a centralized attempt at a FB replacement, incorporating short or long form posts, and live chat, as well as an internal token system (a bit like Reddit gold?). Have an unmerged PR implementing [AP support for following newsfeeds](https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/merge_requests/28).

* :black_nib: [WeChange](https://github.com/wechange-eg) - "collaboration platform" [considering AP integration](https://wechange.de/project/transition-connect-commons-api/note/aktuelles-zu-transition-connect/)

* :black_nib: [WT Social]() - social network for evidence-based news with crowdsourced flagging and fact-checking, founded by Jimmy Wales, who has said he's [considering supporting AP](https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales/status/1192447180725989376). Currently proprietary but Wales says source code will be released in future. 

## Discontinued Projects That Considered Support for Fediverse Protocols

* :black_nib: postActiv - originally worked with OStatus. Considered [implementing Zot](http://gitea.postactiv.com/postActiv/postActiv/issues/1), and [implementing ActivityPub](http://gitea.postactiv.com/postActiv/postActiv/issues/3). As of May, 2019, [lead dev had lost interest in AP](https://pinafore.social/statuses/102134006705360903).
