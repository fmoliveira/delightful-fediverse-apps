## List of projects that have considered implementing one or more of the fediverse standards (OStatus, ActivityPub, Diaspora, Zot)

*Note*: once the developers of an app firmly commit to an implementation, please move it from this list to the watchlist for the relevant protocol. Most of these projects include both a back-end and a web client, but this list also includes projects that are only a back-end. Projects that are only a web app, for use with an existing back-end, will go on the [client watchlist](https://gitlab.com/fediverse/fediverse.gitlab.io/wikis/watchlist-for-client-apps).

* :black_nib: [Communecter](https://github.com/pixelhumain/) - already supports ActivityStreams, [plans to implement the rest of ActivityPub](https://www.loomio.org/d/Y8kHSzPE/activitypub-as-a-decentralized-oae-infrastructure-/3). Codebase is currently being [refactored into a set of smaller components](https://www.loomio.org/d/Y8kHSzPE/activitypub-as-a-decentralized-oae-infrastructure-/19).

* :black_nib: [Dreamwidth](https://github.com/dreamwidth/dw-free/issues/2337) - a blogging engine forked from LiveJournal. Some discussion of the possibilities of supporting ActivityPub.

* :black_nib: [Ghost](https://forum.ghost.org/t/federate-over-activitypub/1989/15) - some discussion of the possibilities of supporting ActivityPub.

* :black_nib: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/4013) - some discussion of the possibilities of supporting ActivityPub. See also: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/30991 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/44486. Most likely to happen if and when ForgeFed is completed.

* :black_nib: [Human Connection](https://github.com/Human-Connection/Human-Connection/issues/114) - some discussion of the possibilities of supporting ActivityPub.

* :black_nib: [Kitsune](https://github.com/valerauko/kitsune/issues/14) - considering supporting the Diaspora standard.

* :black_nib: :heavy_check_mark: postActiv - already works with OStatus, has considered [implementing Zot](http://gitea.postactiv.com/postActiv/postActiv/issues/1), and [implementing ActivityPub](http://gitea.postactiv.com/postActiv/postActiv/issues/3). As of May, 2019, [lead dev is not keen on the AP network](https://pinafore.social/statuses/102134006705360903).
