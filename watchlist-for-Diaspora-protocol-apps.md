:heavy_check_mark: == **added to live website at [fediverse.party](https://fediverse.party)**

:tada: == **projects that have successfully federated with this protocol**

:black_nib: == newly added to this page (added, not altered. Only @light to remove please)

*Note*: Tools with open protocol issue (not yet implemented), not fully open sourced code, no documentation at all, or alpha state with development inactive for several months, not added for now.

### List of projects that have or are committed to implementation of the Diaspora protocols

*Note*: most of these projects include both a back-end and a web client, but this list also includes projects that are only a back-end. Projects that are only a web app, for use with an existing back-end, will go on the [client watchlist](https://git.feneas.org/feneas/fediverse/wikis/watchlist-for-client-apps).
