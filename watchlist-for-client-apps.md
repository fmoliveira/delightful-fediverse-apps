This is a list of client apps that can be used with fediverse servers apps. It includes both web apps that are not the default UI (eg Pinafore, Brutaldon), and native apps for desktop or mobile OS. The list is sorted according to which server(s) or server>client protocol(s) it is compatible with.

*note*: The main purpose of this list is to help people find a maintained app suitable for their day-to-day use. However, if source code is available for abandoned apps, a section will be added for that at the end of the list, so people know we haven't just overlooked them, and in case development restarts.

Mastodon

*note*: Mastodon's bespoke server>client protocol also used by Pleroma, so any client designed to work with Mastodon ought to work with both.
