This Wiki is for research about the fediverse, and federated network technologies in general. Information gathered here will be used to guide and inform future updates to fediverse.party, a guide to the fediverse for newcomers. Contributors welcome!

As well as technical contributions to maintaining the website itself ([pull requests welcome](https://gitlab.com/fediverse/fediverse.gitlab.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)), we welcome anyone with an interest in federated network tech, and a willingness to be do thorough research and fact checking, to add or update information in this wiki. If you want to join the project on an ongoing basis, either as a technical or research contributor, please contact @lostinlight about being included in the Friendica group issue we currently use as our internal group chat.
