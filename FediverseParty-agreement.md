**1.** Account will post about anything `*`Fediverse related but not violating rule (3). New software announcements / reshares, welcoming any Fedi newcomer movements (TwitterExodusScotland etc), promoting Fedi projects, posting useful bits of info about Fedi (nicely formated with points â€¢, emojis, paragraphs, etc).

**2.** Posts must not be explicitly *politically* or *religiously* aligned because not all editors have similar political / religious views and have the same opinion about controversial Fedi topics / dramas. Better leave such posts for one's personal accounts. Please, be friendly and optimistic (we're a "party", after all:).

**3.** Each post from this account will end with a line indicating its author in any of these forms: "by @nickname@server.com", "by Strypey". Additionally, the account profile description will list all its administrators: "This account is administered by @.., @.., @.. and @..". The followers will understand who they're talking to / whom each individual answer in the thread represents.

**4.**. Any *Direct Messages* sent from this account for "official" private questions / offers to Fedi developers will also be signed at the end similar to public posts (see (4)). Any account administrator will read these DMs but won't answer in the DM thread unless they are the one who initiated the conversation - or unless they also want to take part in the conversation with their own suggestions. Our correspondents must not be confused who they're talking to. 

`*`By Fediverse we currently agree to count software using any of the four protocols: diaspora, ActivityPub, Zot, OStatus. We won't post about XMPP, Matrix or any other federating things from this account.
