### List of projects that have a Zot implementation or have committed to one

*Note*: most of these projects include both a back-end and a web client, but this list also includes projects that are only a back-end. Projects that are only a web app, for use with an existing back-end, will go on the client list [here](https://gitlab.com/fediverse/fediverse.gitlab.io/wikis/watchlist-for-client-apps).
