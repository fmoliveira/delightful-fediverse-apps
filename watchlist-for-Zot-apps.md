&#10004; == **added to live website**

[Tools with open protocol issue (not yet implemented), not fully open sourced code, no documentation at all, or alpha state with development inactive for several months - not added for now]

*Note*: most of these projects include both a back-end and a web client, but this list also includes projects that are only a back-end. Projects that are only a web app, for use with an existing back-end, will go on the client list [here](https://gitlab.com/fediverse/fediverse.gitlab.io/wikis/watchlist-for-client-apps).
