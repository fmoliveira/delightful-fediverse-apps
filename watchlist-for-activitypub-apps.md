This is the list of projects that may be implementing ActivityPub, which began in this issue:
https://gitlab.com/fediverse/fediverse.gitlab.io/issues/8

Note: none of these apps ought to be added to the official fediverse.party site until they have been tested with at least one (ideally 2-3) of the AP apps already listed, and can be confirmed to federate successfully. Once it is on the official site, it can be removed from this list, keeping it a list of apps to be watched/ tested.

The [SocialWG has a list](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/ActivityPub_network) of projects they hope will implement ActivityPub and links to Issues where it&#39;s discussed. Also, there is an [implementation report on ActivityPub.rocks](https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/). @Mayel from Social.coop is maintaining a [web spreadsheet of AP apps](https://ethercalc.org/fediverse-stacks) and their characteristics. More projects using AP are [profiled on We Distribute](https://medium.com/we-distribute) by Sean Tilley. From these and other sources (see links), it looks like all these apps are either considering, working on, or already rolling out AP support:
