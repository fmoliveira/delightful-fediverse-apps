#### Is it Alive?

Projects that seem dormant and may be dead, but may also be doing dev quietly in private, or have moved to a new code forge without leaving a forwarding address, etc. Any information that could help us clarify whether these projects are still alive would be much appreciated.

* **[Anancus](https://gitlab.com/tuxether/anancus)**: By [@tuxether](https://floss.social/@tuxether), Link aggregator, [discontinued](https://gitlab.com/tuxether/anancus/issues/2)?

* :black_nib: **[Lamia](https://github.com/Scarly-Crow/lamia)**: Distributed blogging, polls, and status updates powered by activitypub, python, the gay agenda, and snake women. `AGPL-3.0, Python`

* :heavy_check_mark: **[Prismo](https://gitlab.com/prismosuite/prismo)** ([Fedi account](https://mastodon.social/@prismo)): Link aggregator `AGPL-3.0, Ruby`

* :heavy_check_mark: **[reel2bits](https://github.com/rhaamo/reel2bits)** ([site](https://reel2bits.org)): Music and podcast hosting, `AGPL-3.0, Python`

* **[FediQuest](https://shapegoal.org/matejlach/fediQ-server)** ([site](https://shapegoal.org)): A federated alternative to traditionally centralized question & answer platforms, such as Quora/StackOverflow. `GPL-3.0, Go`

#### It's Dead, Jim

Projects that are officially abandoned by the maintainers or with no signs of life on their code repo or any other official channels for more than a year. Listed on this watchlist just in case anyone doesn't realize they're dead, and thinks we just didn't know about them. Also in case a project is orphaned, then reactivated by a new developer.

* [Acorde](https://github.com/polymerwitch/Acorde) - federated social music platform. Almost a year has passed since the initial commit.

* [ActivityPub.jl](https://github.com/Matt5sean3/ActivityPub.jl) - AP support in the Julia language by [@Matt5sean3](https://rva.party/@Matt5sean3), no commits since August, 2018. Project is [missing, presumed dead](https://github.com/Matt5sean3/ActivityPub.jl/issues/1).

* [Calendar-social](https://gitea.polonkai.eu/gergely/calendar-social/) - was definitely planning to [implement AP](https://gitea.polonkai.eu/gergely/calendar-social/issues/122). Missing, [presumed discontinued](https://gitea.polonkai.eu/gergely/calendar-social/issues/123)

* [CloutStream](https://web.archive.org/web/20180808152307/http://cloutstream.com/) - proposed by [@mwpdx](https://mstdn.io/@mwpdx/100591379202470027) as a federated replacement for LinkedIn. Both @cloutstream and @mwpdx Mastodon.social accounts appears to have been removed from the server, all the project tools appear to be down, or removed from the host. 

* [fed](https://github.com/kissen/fed): Trying to be a basic twitter-like service that works with ActivityPub. Based on [Go-Fed](https://go-fed.org) `GPL-3.0, Go`

* [FedEvent](https://github.com/shiburizu/fedevent): A prototype for federating event information

* [Fontina](https://github.com/beta-phenylethylamine/fontina) - proposed as a photo-sharing social media network. GH repo has gone read-only, and now says "dead project".

* [GangGo](https://git.feneas.org/ganggo/federation/issues/17)  - Seems to have settled on using [Go-Fed for AP federation](https://git.feneas.org/ganggo/activity). Developer has suspended development for the foreseeable future.

* [Indienet](https://source.ind.ie/indienet) - [homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20190507034117/https://indienet.info/) - abandoned in favour of [Tincan development](https://small-tech.org/research-and-development/).

* **[Kitsune](https://github.com/valerauko/kitsune)**: early alpha; no commits since November 2018; homepage down

* [Numa](https://github.com/numaverse/numaverse-gateway/issues/3) - built on Ethereum blockchain but intended to federate with AP. No commits since April 2018. No reply on issue about AP compatibility testing from May 8. Homepage now a spam site.

* :heavy_check_mark: [Osada](https://framagit.org/zot/osada) - Osada was a full featured social network application running under the ActivityPub protocol. It also communicated with and inter-operated with servers on the Zot6 network. Abandoned by the developers in March 2019 (**Update**: Recent activity Aug 2020, moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/zot/osada)).

* [Places.pub](https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/282): AP implementation testing tool?

* [Pylodon](https://github.com/rowanlupton/pylodon) - Flask-based (Python) ActivityPub server , [source code also on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rowanlupton/pylodon), no updates on either repo for about a year, nor on their [Smilodon client app](https://github.com/rowanlupton/smilodon).

* [Quit.im](https://quit.im) - this was a photo-sharing web client for a GNU social server, rather than a completely separate app. It would become an AP implementation when the AP plug-in for GS is done, but it's been obsoleted by the release of PixelFed.

* [Smilodon](https://gitlab.com/tuxcrafting/smilodon) (server by Tuxcraft) - abandoned by developer "I'm now [working on Sminos](https://gitlab.com/tuxcrafting/sminos/issues/1) and so this will probably be 100% abandoned. There's not much to salvage, its code is cancer." Sminos appears to have never got beyond the initial commits.

Aside from project homepages and issue trackers, and comments made on the fediverse, the [SocialWG has a list](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/ActivityPub_network) of projects they hoped would implement ActivityPub and links to issues where it's discussed. Also, there is an [implementation report on ActivityPub.rocks](https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/). @Mayel from Social.coop created a [web spreadsheet of AP apps](https://ethercalc.org/fediverse-stacks) and their characteristics. More projects using AP are [profiled on We Distribute](http://wedistribute.org/) by Sean Tilley and his team. There are boards for discussing a range of [AP implementations on the SocialHub forum](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/c/software/14). [Alternative.to](https://alternativeto.net/list/5696/activitypub) has a list of AP servers and client apps. The [ActivityPub tag on GH](https://github.com/topics/activitypub) is also a way to discover projects experimenting with AP.
