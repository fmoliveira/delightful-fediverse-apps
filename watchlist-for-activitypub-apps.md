:heavy_check_mark: == **added to live website**

:tada: == **projects that have successfully federated with this protocol**

:black_nib: == newly added to this page (added, not altered. Only @light to remove please)

*Note*: Tools with open protocol issue (not yet implemented), not fully open sourced code, no documentation at all, or alpha state with development inactive for several months, not added for now.

## List of projects that have an ActivityPub implementation or are committed to one

*Note*: Most of these projects include both a back-end and a web client, but this list can also include projects that are only a back-end. Projects that are only a web app, for use with an existing back-end, will go on the [client watchlist ](https://git.feneas.org/feneas/fediverse/wikis/watchlist-for-client-apps).

#### It's Dead, Jim

Projects that are officially abandoned by the maintainers or with no signs of life on their code repo or any other official channels for more than a year. Listed on this watchlist just in case anyone doesn't realize they're dead, and thinks we just didn't know about them. Also in case a project is orphaned, then reactivated by a new developer.

* [Acorde](https://github.com/polymerwitch/Acorde) - federated social music platform. Almost a year has passed since the initial commit.

* **[ActivityStreams](https://github.com/OpenSocial/activitystreams)**: Reference Implementation `Apache-2.0, Java`

* [ActivityPub.jl](https://github.com/Matt5sean3/ActivityPub.jl) - AP support in the Julia language by [@Matt5sean3](https://rva.party/@Matt5sean3), no commits since August, 2018. Project is [missing, presumed dead](https://github.com/Matt5sean3/ActivityPub.jl/issues/1).

* [Calendar-social](https://gitea.polonkai.eu/gergely/calendar-social/) - was definitely planning to [implement AP](https://gitea.polonkai.eu/gergely/calendar-social/issues/122). Missing, [presumed discontinued](https://gitea.polonkai.eu/gergely/calendar-social/issues/123)

* [CloutStream](https://web.archive.org/web/20180808152307/http://cloutstream.com/) - proposed by [@mwpdx](https://mstdn.io/@mwpdx/100591379202470027) as a federated replacement for LinkedIn. Both @cloutstream and @mwpdx Mastodon.social accounts appears to have been removed from the server, all the project tools appear to be down, or removed from the host. 

* [Fontina](https://github.com/beta-phenylethylamine/fontina) - proposed as a photo-sharing social media network. GH repo has gone read-only, and now says "dead project".

* [GangGo](https://git.feneas.org/ganggo/federation/issues/17)  - Seems to have settled on using [Go-Fed for AP federation](https://git.feneas.org/ganggo/activity). Developer has suspended development for the foreseeable future.

* [Indienet](https://source.ind.ie/indienet) - [homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20190507034117/https://indienet.info/) - abandoned in favour of [Tincan development](https://small-tech.org/research-and-development/).

* **[Kitsune](https://github.com/valerauko/kitsune)**: early alpha; no commits since November 2018; homepage down

* [Numa](https://github.com/numaverse/numaverse-gateway/issues/3) - built on Ethereum blockchain but intended to federate with AP. No commits since April 2018. No reply on issue about AP compatibility testing from May 8. Homepage now a spam site.

* [Osada](https://framagit.org/zot/osada) - Osada was a full featured social network application running under the ActivityPub protocol. It also communicated with and inter-operated with servers on the Zot6 network. Abandoned by the developers in March 2019.

* [Pylodon](https://github.com/rowanlupton/pylodon) - Flask-based (Python) ActivityPub server , [source code also on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rowanlupton/pylodon), no updates on either repo for about a year, nor on their [Smilodon client app](https://github.com/rowanlupton/smilodon).

* [Quit.im](https://quit.im) - this was a photo-sharing web client for a GNU social server, rather than a completely separate app. It would become an AP implementation when the AP plug-in for GS is done, but it's been obsoleted by the release of PixelFed.

* [Smilodon](https://gitlab.com/tuxcrafting/smilodon) (server by Tuxcraft) - abandoned by developer "I'm now [working on Sminos](https://gitlab.com/tuxcrafting/sminos/issues/1) and so this will probably be 100% abandoned. There's not much to salvage, its code is cancer." Sminos appears to have never got beyond the initial commits.

## Sources

Aside from project homepages and issue trackers, and comments made on the fediverse, the [SocialWG has a list](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/ActivityPub_network) of projects they hoped would implement ActivityPub and links to Issues where it's discussed. Also, there is an [implementation report on ActivityPub.rocks](https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/). @Mayel from Social.coop created a [web spreadsheet of AP apps](https://ethercalc.org/fediverse-stacks) and their characteristics. More projects using AP are [profiled on We Distribute](http://wedistribute.org/) by Sean Tilley and his team. [Alternative.to](https://alternativeto.net/list/5696/activitypub) has a list of AP servers and client apps. The [ActivityPub tag on GH](https://github.com/topics/activitypub) is also a way to discover projects experimenting with AP.
