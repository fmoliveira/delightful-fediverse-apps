:heavy_check_mark: == **added to live website at [fediverse.party](https://fediverse.party)**

:tada: == **projects that have successfully federated with this protocol**

:black_nib: == newly added to this page (added, not altered. Only @light to remove please)

*Note*: Tools with open protocol issue (not yet implemented), not fully open sourced code, no documentation at all, or alpha state with development inactive for several months, not added for now.

## List of projects that have an ActivityPub implementation or are committed to one

*Note*: Most of these projects include both a back-end and a web client, but this list can also include projects that are only a back-end. Projects that are only a web app, for use with an existing back-end, will go on the [client watchlist ](https://git.feneas.org/feneas/fediverse/wikis/watchlist-for-client-apps).

Abandoned by the developers in March 2019 (**Update**: Recent activity Aug 2020, moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/zot/osada)).

* [Places.pub](https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/282): AP implementation testing tool?

* [Pylodon](https://github.com/rowanlupton/pylodon) - Flask-based (Python) ActivityPub server , [source code also on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rowanlupton/pylodon), no updates on either repo for about a year, nor on their [Smilodon client app](https://github.com/rowanlupton/smilodon).

* [Quit.im](https://quit.im) - this was a photo-sharing web client for a GNU social server, rather than a completely separate app. It would become an AP implementation when the AP plug-in for GS is done, but it's been obsoleted by the release of PixelFed.

* [Smilodon](https://gitlab.com/tuxcrafting/smilodon) (server by Tuxcraft) - abandoned by developer "I'm now [working on Sminos](https://gitlab.com/tuxcrafting/sminos/issues/1) and so this will probably be 100% abandoned. There's not much to salvage, its code is cancer." Sminos appears to have never got beyond the initial commits.

Aside from project homepages and issue trackers, and comments made on the fediverse, the [SocialWG has a list](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/ActivityPub_network) of projects they hoped would implement ActivityPub and links to issues where it's discussed. Also, there is an [implementation report on ActivityPub.rocks](https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/). @Mayel from Social.coop created a [web spreadsheet of AP apps](https://ethercalc.org/fediverse-stacks) and their characteristics. More projects using AP are [profiled on We Distribute](http://wedistribute.org/) by Sean Tilley and his team. There are boards for discussing a range of [AP implementations on the SocialHub forum](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/c/software/14). [Alternative.to](https://alternativeto.net/list/5696/activitypub) has a list of AP servers and client apps. The [ActivityPub tag on GH](https://github.com/topics/activitypub) is also a way to discover projects experimenting with AP.
