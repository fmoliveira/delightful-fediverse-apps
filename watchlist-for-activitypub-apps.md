&#10004; == **added to live website**

ðŸŽ‰ == **projects that have successfully federated with this protocol**

:black_nib: == newly added to this page (added, not altered. Only @lostinlight to remove please)

*Note*: Tools with open protocol issue (not yet implemented), not fully open sourced code, no documentation at all, or alpha state with development inactive for several months, not added for now.

## List of projects have an ActivityPub implementation or are committed to one

*Note*: This list began in issue https://gitlab.com/fediverse/fediverse.gitlab.io/issues/8. Most of these projects include both a back-end and a web client, but this list can also include projects that are only a back-end. Projects that are only a web app, for use with an existing back-end, will go on the [client watchlist ](https://gitlab.com/fediverse/fediverse.gitlab.io/wikis/watchlist-for-client-apps).

#### Proposed Projects and implementations in development

A place to list rumoured projects for further research, apps whose developers have expressed interest in implementing AP, and vapourware projects that have been planned but no usable code has been written yet. Once it's clear that the project really exists, is definitely working on implementing AP, and code is actually being committed, it can be moved to the appropriate category above.

* [Communecter](https://github.com/pixelhumain/) - already supports ActivityStreams, [plans to implement the rest of AP](https://www.loomio.org/d/Y8kHSzPE/activitypub-as-a-decentralized-oae-infrastructure-/3).

* [Dreamwidth](https://github.com/dreamwidth/dw-free/issues/2337) - a blogging engine forked from LiveJournal.

* &#10006; [Fontina](https://github.com/beta-phenylethylamine/fontina) - proposed as a photo-sharing social media network. GH repo has gone read-only, and now says "dead project".

* &#10006; [Numa](https://github.com/numaverse/numaverse-gateway/issues/3) - built on Ethereum blockchain but intended to federate with AP. No commits since April 2018. No reply on issue about AP compatibility testing from May 8. Homepage now a spam site.

Aside from project homepages and issue trackers, and comments made on the fediverse, the [SocialWG has a list](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/ActivityPub_network) of projects they hoped would implement ActivityPub and links to Issues where it's discussed. Also, there is an [implementation report on ActivityPub.rocks](https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/). @Mayel from Social.coop created a [web spreadsheet of AP apps](https://ethercalc.org/fediverse-stacks) and their characteristics.
