This is a list of federated social clients and other related tools that use protocols other than those used in the fediverse (OStatus, ActivityPub, Diaspora, DFRN, Zot)

#### Blockchain

The [blockchain social apps list](https://gitlab.com/fediverse/fediverse.gitlab.io/wikis/blockchain%20social%20apps?) has its own page, because although all these apps are *distributed* in some way (because they use a blockchain), they're not all *federated* with anything other than other copies of their own app.

#### Matrix

[Matrix](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/faq.html) is a federated web protocol, used mainly so far for realtime chat rooms.

* [Riot](https://about.riot.im/)
