This is a list of federated social clients and other related tools that use protocols other than those used in the fediverse (OStatus, ActivityPub, Diaspora, DFRN, Zot)

#### SSB

[SSB (Secure Scuttlebutt)](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) is a distributed networking protocol based on [DAT](https://www.datprotocol.com/), see also: https://datproject.org/

* [Manyverse](https://www.manyver.se/) is an SSB client for Android/Linux.

* [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/)is an SSB client for desktop platforms (currently supporting GNU/Linux, MacOS, and Windows).

#### XMPP

* [Movim](https://movim.eu) is a web client with social network features, written in PHP and uses ~~eJabberd (Erlang) backend~~ any XMPP server with [XEP-0060 PubSub](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html) support. Users can login to any Movim instance using any XMPP account, just as they can login to any Pinafore instance using any Mastodon account.

* [Salut Ã  Toi](http://salut-a-toi.org/) (includes the Libervia web client) is a social network based on XMPP/Jabber.


#### Blockchain

All these apps are all distributed, because they use a blockchain. But it seems they are all in competition, rather than federating with each other by using a standard set of protocols like ActivityPub to federate with each other. It's hard to see how any of them will gain the network effect to compete with the legacy datafarms. Although some, like Resonate, are (user-owned?) cooperatives, it seems like at least some of the others are just datafarm larvae, aiming to enslave enough users to get Vulture Capitalist funding, and exit by acquisition or IPO - Strypey
